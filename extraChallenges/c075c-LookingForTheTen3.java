/*
Looking for the Ten

You are given all the marks you have obtained in a class. Each mark is between 
0 and 10 inclusive.

Assuming that in all your next tasks you will get a 10, determine the number of 
tasks necessary to obtain a 10. You will receive a 10 if your average is 9.5 or 
higher.

For example, if your marks are 8, 9 then you will require 4 additional tasks in 
which you will have to get 10. With each task your average would be increased 
to 9, 9.25, 9.4 and 9.5.

Input

The entry is in a line that contains all the notes you got separated by a comma.

Output

Write in one line the number of tasks required to obtain a 10.


Input examples

9,10,10,9
